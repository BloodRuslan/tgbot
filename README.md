# tgbot
tg bot for message forwarding from 1 groups to others
1. U need to install requirements because i used old libraries for pyrogram
2. U need to get pyrogramm string session (tg bot - pyrogram string session generator, or just google the same phrase), api hash and api id on https://my.telegram.org/auth
3. If it gives an error on session string, delete last 5 digits in it (dont rly remember how many)
4. Enjoy and send me some ETH :) (0x98504a43E51fbF75D2abfb67b6422e230B8731C0) or BNB (0x98504a43E51fbF75D2abfb67b6422e230B8731C0)
